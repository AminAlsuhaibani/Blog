## 2. Equality? More Like a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure

Why settle for one way of comparing things when you can have two? JavaScript offers both `==` and `===`—with `==` being the wild card. If you’re feeling adventurous (or just confused), try predicting the outcome of comparisons. Spoiler: it’s usually not what you expect!

**Example:**
```js
console.log(0 == false);  // true
console.log(0 === false); // false
